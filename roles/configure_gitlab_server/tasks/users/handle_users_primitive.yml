        ## note: generating a very long random password and never telling 
        ##   anyone seems atm the best way to implement no-password-access, 
        ##   altough technically password access is still obvious possible 
        ##   if someone get hold of the pw somehow (e.g. brute forcing), 
        ##   alternatives:
        ##
        ##     - explicitly configure gitlab server to disable pw access 
        ##       for user: this would be without a doubt the best solution, 
        ##       but as far as I can tell is not (yet) supported by gitlab
        ##
        ##     - use "force_random_password" parameter of gitlab API: this 
        ##       is more or less the same solution as this, except that the 
        ##       random pw is created inside gitlab, the one caveat is that 
        ##       as gitlab API does support this param only for newly 
        ##       creating users, it cannot be regularly cycled, but by 
        ##       creating this pw in ansible, a fresh new pw is set every 
        ##       time ansible is run
        ##
        ##     - use "reset_password" parameter of gitlab API and never 
        ##       acting on the mail:
        ##
        ##         * mail is a rather insecure medium
        ##         * not sure if this is actually technical feasable: 
        ##             can one interact with the user per ssh / token when pw reset is pending?
        ##
        ##         * not sure if this is actual technical secure: 
        ##             even if the mail is burned and no one had a chance 
        ##             to see it, is this secure at all having the same 
        ##             system constantly pw reset pending?
